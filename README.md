👋 Hi, I’m Jesioon, I'm 23 years old, I come from Poland, from Lublin. I am studying at the Faculty of Electronic at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. My field of study is Telecommunication. My specialization is data communication networks. I am in the third year, six semester.

👀 I’m interested in programming since I had my first class about C++ at Wrocław University. That day I wrote my first 'hello world' using CodeBlock. I was learning C++ for a year and I wrote a game to pass an exam. That was 'ludo'. Next year at University I was learning C, but I really didn't like it. Since August 2020 I back to high level programming but in diffrent language, becouse I choose Python and I'm really happy with that decision.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python of course with Django framework. I'm learning front-end stack too: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap. In future I want to improve my skills in that technologies and study ReactJS.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Web Applications with company where I could learn a lot of things. I like solving programming problems becouse it is really satisfying.
